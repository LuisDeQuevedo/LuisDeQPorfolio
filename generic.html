						<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ProfilePic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						Welcome to my website! I am excited to share all of my engineering projects thus far, but first 
						a little about myself. I am a senior at Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am 
						earning a bachelors of art in mechanical engineering. I am all about problem-solving and 
						learning innovative ways to tackle new projects. 
						I am enthusiastic about aerospace and robotics, as reflected by my school and personal projects.
						<br/>I am an active member of Columbia's Airplane Club, a dynamic and collaborative community where we come together as a team with a shared passion for aeronautics and aviation. Within the club, our primary focus revolves around the exciting and hands-on task of designing, constructing, and piloting remote-controlled (RC) planes. These planes are not merely static models but fully functional aircraft capable of taking to the skies.

						<br/>
						Our involvement in this endeavor extends beyond the workshop and into the open skies, as we participate in yearly competitions. These competitions serve as an arena where we put our aircraft to the test, showcasing our technical expertise and flying skills. It's a thrilling experience that combines creativity, engineering, and precision, as we navigate challenges and strive for excellence in both design and flight performance.
						<br/>
						Being a part of the Columbia Airplane Club has not only provided me with the opportunity to develop my knowledge and skills in aviation and aircraft design but has also allowed me to collaborate with like-minded peers, fostering teamwork, camaraderie, and a shared dedication to the exciting world of RC planes. It's an environment that encourages exploration, innovation, and a deep appreciation for the wonders of flight. </p>
